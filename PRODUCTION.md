# Production Deployment Guide

## Deployment Configuration Fixed

The following issues have been resolved for production deployment:

### ✅ Build Scripts
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` - Creates optimized builds for frontend and backend
- **Production Start**: `npm start` - Runs the production server from built files
- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Development server with hot reloading

### ✅ Server Configuration
- **Environment Detection**: Server automatically switches between dev/production modes
- **Static File Serving**: Production mode serves pre-built static files from `dist/public/`
- **Port Configuration**: Uses `PORT` environment variable (default: 5000)
- **Host Binding**: Configured for `0.0.0.0` for proper deployment access

### ✅ Build Output Structure
```
dist/
├── index.js          # Bundled production server
└── public/           # Built frontend assets
    ├── index.html    # Main HTML file
    └── assets/       # Optimized CSS/JS bundles
```

### ✅ Environment Variables
The application requires these environment variables for production:

#### Required
- `PORT` - Server port (provided by Replit automatically)
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Enables production mode

#### Optional (MCP Agent Integration)
- `FILAZERO_AGENT_URL` - External agent URL (defaults to https://filazero-agent.vercel.app)

### ✅ Production Ready Features
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time messaging works in production
- **Static Asset Optimization**: Minified CSS/JS with compression
- **Error Handling**: Production-grade error logging and handling
- **Session Management**: Memory-based sessions (suitable for Replit deployment)

## Deployment Commands

For Replit deployment, the system should use:
1. **Build**: `npm run build`
2. **Start**: `npm start`

The application is now properly configured for production deployment on Replit.
