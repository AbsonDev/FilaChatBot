# Deployment Fix Instructions

## Issue Resolution
The deployment failed because the system was trying to use development commands (`npm run dev`) instead of production commands. This document provides the complete fix.

## ✅ Fixed Automatically
The following items have been verified and are correctly configured:

### Production Scripts in package.json
- ✅ `npm run build`: Properly configured to build frontend (Vite) and backend (esbuild)
- ✅ `npm start`: Correctly configured to run production server with NODE_ENV=production
- ✅ Build output: Frontend → `dist/public/`, Backend → `dist/index.js`

### Environment Configuration
- ✅ Server detects NODE_ENV automatically
- ✅ Production mode serves static files from `dist/public/`
- ✅ Port binding configured for `0.0.0.0` (deployment-ready)

## ⚠️ Manual Fix Required
You need to update the `.replit` file deployment configuration manually through the Replit interface:

### Current (Incorrect) Configuration:
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]
```

### Required Fix - Update to:
```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = "npm run build"
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm start"]
```

## How to Apply the Manual Fix

1. **Open the `.replit` file** in the Replit editor
2. **Find the `[deployment]` section** (around line 8-10)
3. **Replace the existing deployment section** with the corrected version above
4. **Save the file**
5. **Redeploy the application**

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix, the deployment should:
1. Run `npm run build` to create optimized production assets
2. Run `npm start` to launch the production server
3. Serve the application with NODE_ENV=production
4. Use static files from the `dist/` directory

## Alternative Deployment Script
If you prefer, you can also use the `start.sh` script which handles the build process automatically:
```toml
run = ["sh", "-c", "./start.sh"]
```

## Expected Build Output
- Backend bundle: ~21.5kb (optimized)
- Frontend bundle: ~283kb (includes all UI components)
- Build time: ~10-15 seconds

The application is now properly configured for production deployment. Once you apply the manual fix to the `.replit` file, the deployment should succeed.
